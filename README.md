### Flags
- Preprocessor file flag `-E`
- Assembly file flag `-S`

### Linux
- `export PROMPT_DIRTRIM=2`

### Software
- MinGW
- WSL
- Visual Studio
- LLVM, Clang Format, C++

### Rules
- Compile with `c++` + `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` + `-std=c++98`;
- Exercise directories will be named: `ex00`, `ex01`, ... , `exn`;
- Class names in UpperCamelCase format;
- Files containing class code will always be named according to the class name;
- Output messages must be ended by a `\n` character (except when explicitely stated otherwise);
- No coding style is enforced in the C++ modules;
- You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library;

### Forbidden
- Canâ€™t use any other external library;
- C++11 (and derived forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden;
- The following functions are forbidden too: `*printf()`, `*alloc()` and `free()`;
- Using namespace `<ns_name>` and friend keywords are forbidden;
- You are allowed to use the STL in the Module 08 and 09 only. That means:
  - No Containers (vector/list/map/and so forth);
  - No Algorithms (anything that requires to include the `<algorithm>` header);
- When you allocate memory (by using the `new` keyword), you must avoid memory leaks;
- From Module 02 to Module 09, your classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form (except when explicitely stated otherwise);
- Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates) means 0 to the exercise;
- You should be able to use each of your headers independently from others. They must include all the dependencies they need;
- You must avoid the problem of double inclusion by adding include guards;
